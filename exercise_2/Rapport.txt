Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to compare the effectiveness of two popular dimensionality reduction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), on a given dataset. The dataset is loaded, standardized, and then reduced to 2D and 3D using both PCA and t-SNE. The visualizations are plotted for a qualitative assessment of how well the reduced dimensions separate the data points based on their labels.

Code Overview:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Data and labels are loaded from 'data.npy' and 'labels.npy', respectively.
The data is standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

PCA Dimensionality Reduction:
PCA is applied to reduce the data to 2D and 3D.

Visualization:
Subplots are created to display the results side by side.
Scatter plots are used for both 2D and 3D representations, with different colors indicating different labels.

Conclusion:

The visualizations provide insights into how well PCA and t-SNE capture the underlying structure of the data.
PCA tends to preserve global structure, whereas t-SNE is effective in capturing local relationships.
The choice between PCA and t-SNE depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.
