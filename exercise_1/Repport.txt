Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the convergence of the empirical average of random samples
drawn from two normal distributions to the expected values of those distributions.
We generate random samples representing heights (X) and weights (Y) and observe how the empirical average approaches
the expected values over increasing sample sizes.

Code Overview:

Random Data Generation:

Two normal distributions are generated using np.random.normal to simulate heights (X) and weights (Y).
Parameters for X: mean (mu_x) = 170, standard deviation (sigma_x) = 10.
Parameters for Y: mean (mu_y) = 70, standard deviation (sigma_y) = 15.
Sample size (n) is set to 1000.
Seed for reproducibility is set to 42.
Scatter Plot:

A scatter plot is created to visualize the random samples in a 2D space, where X represents height and Y represents weight.

Convergence Analysis:
Empirical averages are computed for increasing sample sizes using np.cumsum and then dividing by the number of samples.
Expected values are defined based on the distribution parameters.
Euclidean distances between the empirical averages and expected values are calculated.

Convergence Plot:
A plot is created to illustrate how the Euclidean distance between the empirical 
average and the expected value changes with an increasing number of samples.

Conclusion:
The scatter plot visually represents random samples of heights and weights, while the convergence plot demonstrates 
how the empirical average converges to the expected values as the sample size increases. 
This exercise provides a practical illustration of the law of large numbers, 
showing how sample averages become more accurate estimators of population means with larger sample sizes.
