Objective:
This analysis aims to explore and gain insights from the Olympic dataset. Various steps are performed, 
including data cleaning, basic statistical analysis, visualization of medal distribution, and K-means clustering on selected features.

1. Data Loading and Overview:

The Olympic dataset is loaded from the "dataset_olympics.csv" file.
Basic information about the dataset is displayed using info().
The first few rows of the dataset are printed to provide an initial look at the data.

2. General Analysis:

Descriptive statistics and the count of missing values are calculated to understand the overall characteristics of the dataset.

3. Distribution of Medals by Country:

The number of medals is aggregated by country, and the top 10 countries with the highest medal counts are visualized using a bar plot.

4. Preprocessing:

Missing values are imputed using the most frequent strategy.
The 'Sex' column is label-encoded for further analysis.

5. Visualization of Medals Over the Years:

The distribution of medals over the years is visualized for the top 5 teams with the highest cumulative medal counts.

6. K-means Clustering:

Relevant features ('Age' and 'Year') are selected for clustering.
Numeric data is standardized using StandardScaler.
K-means clustering is applied with a specified number of clusters (in this case, 2), and clusters are visualized.

Conclusion:

The analysis provides a comprehensive exploration of the Olympic dataset, including descriptive statistics, 
visualization of medal distribution, and K-means clustering.
The distribution of medals over the years for top teams offers insights into historical performance trends.
K-means clustering on age and year features visually separates data points into clusters, 
potentially revealing underlying patterns or trends in the dataset. Adjusting the number of clusters may yield different insights.
